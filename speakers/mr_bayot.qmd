-   Mr. Roldan E. Bayot is an Entomologist III at the Department of Health – Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), under the Medical Entomology Department, and currently serves as the Officer-in-Charge of the Insecticide Resistance Section. Since joining the Institute in 2018, he has been deeply involved in medical entomology research, with a specialized focus on insecticide resistance monitoring of mosquito-borne disease vectors. His key responsibilities include mosquito identification from routine surveillance and outbreak investigations, development of research proposals for grant funding, and the provision of technical support to both government and non-government stakeholders.

-   He earned his Bachelor’s Degree in Agriculture, major in Entomology, from the University of the Philippines Los Baños. His research portfolio encompasses assessing the susceptibility of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae and adults to commonly used insecticides, as well as evaluating the role of Piperonyl Butoxide (PBO) in restoring pyrethroid susceptibility and its implications for vector control strategies in the Philippines. He is also currently developing research proposals on establishing a method for the rapid assessment of insecticide formulation toxicity for program operations and investigating intergenerational resistance—efforts aimed at strengthening evidence-based public health interventions
