-   A Senior Science Research Specialist at the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance Laboratory of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), where she has served as laboratory technical staff since 2007.

-   She earned her Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology from the University of Santo Tomas and further specialized by completing a diploma course in Medical Microbiology at the Institute of Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Currently, she is enhancing her expertise by pursuing a Master’s in International Health at the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU).

-   Her core technical specialization includes performing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens, a technique she has leveraged to contribute significantly to multiple research projects and publications focused on AMR surveillance. Demonstrating a commitment to a broader public health scope, Ms. Macaranas is also deeply involved in One Health initiatives. This includes her participation in the Tricycle project, which monitors E. coli AMR across human, animal, and environmental sectors, and the TULIP project, which investigates the role of microplastics in driving AMR dissemination in aquatic settings. Her work is crucial to national surveillance and global health efforts against antimicrobial resistance.
